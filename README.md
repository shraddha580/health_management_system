# bank_management_system


This Bank Management System is a desktop application developed using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface to manage bank customer records efficiently. The system supports all core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to add new customers, view existing records, update customer details, and delete records as needed.

All customer data is stored securely in a database, ensuring data persistence and reliability. Any changes made through the GUI are immediately reflected in the database, providing real-time synchronization between the interface and stored records. This project demonstrates effective integration of Python GUI development with backend database management to create a practical and reliable tool for banking data management.
